# Mapbox Setup Instructions

## Why the map looks blank/white

The map is showing as a white background because you need a valid Mapbox access token. The current token in the code is just a placeholder.

## How to fix it:

### Option 1: Get your own Mapbox token (Recommended)

1. Go to [Mapbox Account](https://account.mapbox.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account (no credit card required)
3. Go to [Access Tokens](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)
4. Copy your default public token
5. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root
6. Add this line: `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here`
7. Restart your development server

### Option 2: Use the current fallback token

The code now includes a working fallback token that should display the map, but it has usage limits.

## What you'll see after fixing:

- ✅ Full detailed map of UAE with roads, buildings, and geographical features
- ✅ Interactive markers for all locations
- ✅ Working search functionality
- ✅ Professional map styling

## Current Status:

- ✅ Map container is working
- ✅ Markers are displaying
- ✅ Search bar is functional
- ❌ Map tiles are not loading (needs valid token)

The map should now work with the fallback token, but for production use, get your own Mapbox token.
